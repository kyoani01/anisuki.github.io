    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                  allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                  to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                  versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                  database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Anisukidev.
                </p> <p>
                  Anisukidev is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The +100000 Anime Live Wallpaper app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, to provide my
                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                  that the +100000 Anime Live Wallpaper app won’t work properly or at all.
                </p> <div><p>
                    The app does use third-party services that declare their
                    Terms and Conditions.

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Anisukidev will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Anisukidev
                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Anisukidev cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Anisukidev cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Anisukidev’s responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Anisukidev accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android – the requirements for the 
                  system(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Anisukidev does not promise that it
                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Terms and Conditions
                  from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                  Conditions on this page.
                </p> <p>
                  These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-07-20
                 <strong>ABOUT PAYMENT  &amp; AND SUBSCRIPTION </strong> <p>
                 The subscription experience is not required to use the app, unless you want to benefit from a free-ad experience. 
                 If you want to purchase subscription you will be asked to provide information about your (payment method through third party Google Play).
                 If you provide your payment information (e.g., name, billing address, credit card information) you authorize third party Google Play to receive, store and encrypt your payment information.
                 When you pay through the Google Play, you may change your payment method through the corresponding store account.
                 You warrant that all such billing information is complete and accurate, and that you are authorized to use such account information for such payments.
                 The use of a third party payment service (“Payment Processor”) is subject to any terms and conditions made available by the Payment Processor, and you must comply with all such terms and conditions. 
                 You acknowledge that you may be separately required to accept the Payment Processor’s own terms governing use of its services in the manner it specifies.
                 We offer you the ability to purchase a monthly subscription for an ad-free and premium wallpapers experience. When you purchase a subscription, you understand that it is a membership that automatically renews itself every month indefinitely without action. 
                 Google play will charge the current monthly membership fee to the billing account that you designated as your preference, or if you have not designated a preference, to the payment mechanisms, such as a debit or credit card, most recently used on the Services. 
                 The benefits of your subscription will be suspended unless and until payment is received, provided payment is received within 7 days (grace period). If payment is not received within 7 days, your subscription will be cancelled.
                 Your subscription start without a free trial. The subscription period is counted from the moment you subscribed.
                 You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play account. You can find information on how to cancel your subscription through your Google Play account by visiting https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481.
